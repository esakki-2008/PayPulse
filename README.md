# PayPulse

> **Every payment has a pulse. We make it actionable.**

PayPulse is an AI Payment Intelligence & Action Agent for the PayPal AI Hackathon. It turns merchant payment behavior into explainable **Payment DNA**, prioritizes meaningful change, and prepares human-approved next actions.

## Current status — Phase 3 foundation

The working Phase 3 experience is an immersive, responsive command center with a 3D Payment Intelligence Core, Payment Universe, customer Payment DNA views, explainable intelligence signals, and an approval-gated Action Center.

All UI payment intelligence is clearly marked as **synthetic demo data**. PayPal Sandbox OAuth is server-only and independently verifiable, but Phase 3 does not query transaction APIs, create orders, or execute any financial action.

### Run the command center

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Safety boundary

PayPulse is designed for **PayPal Sandbox only** during development and demonstration:

- No real-money transactions or live PayPal endpoint
- No hard-coded credentials or browser-visible secrets
- No autonomous financially sensitive action
- Every recommendation follows **WHY → WHAT → EXPECTED IMPACT → APPROVAL**
- Phase 3 action execution is explicitly disabled; an approval does not trigger PayPal

## Product loop

## Verification

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

The credential-backed Sandbox connectivity test runs only when the local developer environment has been securely configured; it never requires credentials in Git, the UI, or chat.
